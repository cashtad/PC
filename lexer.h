/**
 * @brief Represents a lexer that tokenizes the input text.
 *
 * The `Lexer` structure holds the state of the lexer, which is responsible for breaking down
 * the input text into tokens. These tokens are then processed by the parser to build an abstract
 * syntax tree (AST). The lexer reads characters from the input string and identifies the
 * appropriate tokens (numbers, operators, functions, parentheses, etc.).
 *
 * The structure contains the following fields:
 * - `text`: A pointer to the input text that the lexer is parsing.
 * - `pos`: The current position (index) in the text being processed.
 * - `current_char`: The current character being analyzed in the input text.
 * - `amount_of_left_brackets`: A counter for the number of left parentheses encountered in the text.
 * - `amount_of_right_brackets`: A counter for the number of right parentheses encountered in the text.
 *
 * The lexer maintains these fields to efficiently traverse and analyze the input text character by character.
 * It uses this state information to detect tokens such as numbers, operators, functions, and parentheses.
 * It also ensures that parentheses are balanced and manages the position in the input text as tokens are processed.

/**
 * @brief Enum representing different types of tokens that can be identified in the input text.
 *
 * The `TokenType` enumeration defines the various types of tokens that the lexer can recognize
 * when parsing the input expression. Each token corresponds to a specific type of character or
 * symbol that plays a role in the expression being parsed.
 *
 * The enumeration includes the following values:
 * - `TOKEN_NUM`: Represents a numeric token (e.g., numbers like 42, 3.14, 3E+5).
 * - `TOKEN_ID`: Represents an identifier token (e.g., variable names like 'x' or 'y').
 * - `TOKEN_FUNC`: Represents a function name token (e.g., mathematical functions like 'sin', 'cos').
 * - `TOKEN_PLUS`: Represents the '+' operator token, used for addition.
 * - `TOKEN_MINUS`: Represents the '-' operator token, used for subtraction.
 * - `TOKEN_MUL`: Represents the '*' operator token, used for multiplication.
 * - `TOKEN_DIV`: Represents the '/' operator token, used for division.
 * - `TOKEN_LPAREN`: Represents the left parenthesis token '('.
 * - `TOKEN_RPAREN`: Represents the right parenthesis token ')'.
 * - `TOKEN_POW`: Represents the '^' operator token, used for exponentiation.
 * - `TOKEN_EOF`: Represents the end of input token, indicating the lexer has finished parsing.
 *
 * These token types are used by the lexer to categorize the characters in the input string and
 * pass them to the parser for further processing, such as building an abstract syntax tree (AST).

/**
 * @brief Struct representing a token in the input text.
 *
 * The `Token` structure is used to represent a single token, which is a categorized unit of

 * `TokenType` enum, and depending on its type, it may contain additional data such as a number,
 * a variable identifier, or a function name.
 *
 * The structure includes the following fields:
 * - `type`: Specifies the type of token, which determines how the token should be interpreted.
 *          The type is one of the values from the `TokenType` enumeration (e.g., `TOKEN_NUM`,
 *          `TOKEN_ID`, `TOKEN_FUNC`).
 * - `num`: Holds the numeric value of the token when the type is `TOKEN_NUM`.
 * - `id`: Holds the string for the identifier (e.g., variable names) when the type is `TOKEN_ID`.
 * - `func`: Holds the string for the function name when the type is `TOKEN_FUNC`. It can store
 *           function names up to 9 characters (plus a null terminator).
 *
 * This structure is used by the lexer to pass information about the tokens to the parser.
 * Each token corresponds to a specific part of the input expression, such as a number,
 * an operator, or a function.
